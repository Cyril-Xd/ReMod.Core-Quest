element hierarchy:
MMPage>MMCategory>MMCategorySection>MMelement (toggle, slider, etc.)
elements must be in a section to function properly

i tried to keep the original style of code the best i could

known issue: element text sometimes returns back to the original "always use visual aide" when clicking on its category
i don't know how to fix this rather than checking every single element's text when the category is clicked

todo:
make sidebar category dropdowns work
(maybe) have that little sidebar collapse button in the top left
category title text at the top
avatar and user button carousels
be silly :troll:
